commits: 20f3ce8 chore(render): commit the rescued render leftovers that pass their tests
         1a97cb8 feat(render-queue): shared queue across worktrees, per-job tree root, Mac-only mode
         (third commit, this one: docs(render): Mac-only mode and worktree jobs)
pushed: head #98 for the first two commits; the head number for this commit follows it on preview
tests: node 629/630 (1 skipped; baseline identical) | smoke PASS (incl. new tools/test_render_queue.py, 14 cases) | arch PASS | probes: none run (no renders started)
deviations: (1) tools/push_preview.sh now pushes HEAD:refs/heads/<branch> instead of the local branch of that name: from a worktree the local `preview` is the main checkout's stale ref, so the documented push command would have been rejected. Identical behavior when run from `preview`. (2) tools/install_renderqueue_agent.sh now waits for bootout to finish and retries bootstrap: on the first T3d run the immediate bootstrap failed with "Input/output error 5" after the old dispatcher was booted out; recovered by a manual `launchctl bootstrap` and the fix is in this commit. (3) The queue usage example in the script header now includes `--log` (the render guard rejects the old example as a legacy call); docs/cloud-render.md's older example still lacks it (grandfathered text). (4) DRY_RUN=1 in the queue now prints the plan and finishes synchronously instead of running blender_run.sh with DRY_RUN=1.
blocker: none
open: none. Rescue folder ~/eden-map-review/rescue/2026-09-30/ keeps house_opt*.glb, house_opt.assets.json, estate_ext.png and eden_estate_tiles.json (nothing references them) as input for a later campaign item.

commits: 777cbed chore(watchdog): ratchet the line cap, z-index, card-term and inline-style checks across the engine
         7ad86f0 docs(arch): add ARCHITECTURE.md (module map, data flow, entity protocol) with zh edition
         (this commit) docs(brief): fix the push rule and read order; clarify the RESULT pushed line   (SHAs may change on rebase)
pushed: yes (head number = the "head #N" commit that follows this one on preview)
tests: node 629/630 (1 skipped; baseline identical) | smoke PASS | arch PASS | probes: none run (tools and docs only)
deviations: (1) tools/smoke.sh: two step labels and the header comment now name the six checks / the ARCHITECTURE mirror pair (text only; no behaviour change). (2) The plan defines no verbatim text for SpatialNode / PresentEntities / WorldRoster / Stash; ARCHITECTURE.md §1 defines them from plan §2 / S6 plus the current code and marks each with its state. (3) check_architecture.py gained a small strip() fix: `://` no longer starts a line comment (checks 2 and 5 give identical results on the repo). (4) Style attributes that only set CSS custom properties (style="--c:...") are counted by check 6, as literally specified.
blocker: none
open: check 6 counts `style="--x:..."` attributes (custom-property-only) as inline styles per the letter of the prompt; say if those should be exempt like style.setProperty('--…').
  Initial baseline totals: lines 5 files / 4052 lines over cap (eden-map.js 1535, viewer3d.html 916, viewer.html 717, custom.mjs 456, events.mjs 428); zindex 15 files / 33; terms 30 files / 206 (tavern/events.mjs 87, i18n/zh.json 20, events.mjs 16, viewer.html 13, app/locate.mjs 9); inline_style 27 files / 66. map/core: zero violations of any kind (nothing baselined). Engine scan: 146 files + 2 i18n dictionaries.

commits: 6e84ad4 feat(render): campaign ledger tool (items + append-only events, lanes, claims, freeze check)
         (this commit) docs(render): render campaign item list and status view   (SHAs may change on rebase)
pushed: yes (head number = the "head #N" commit that follows this one on preview)
tests: node 629/630 (1 skipped; baseline identical) | smoke PASS (incl. new tools/test_render_campaign.py, 40 cases) | arch PASS | probes: none run (no renders started)
deviations: (1) The item-list rules live in a second file, tools/render_campaign_items.py (imported by `init`), to keep render_campaign.py readable. (2) landmark.py's real stages (new, draft, board, gapcheck, final, ship) match the prompt; setting / review-r1 / fix / review-r2 are ledger-only stages with no landmark.py command, so `next` prints instructions for them instead of a command. (3) Rules the prompt left open, decided as: `fail` releases the claim; a claim's TTL counts from the owner's latest event; `wait` on a non-ship stage only refreshes the claim; events replay sorted by (ts, file order); overlapping claims: the first one wins; done / skip / fail / wait must name the item's current stage; review-r1 / review-r2 `done` requires --gate. (4) base / variant `--out` paths point at logs/campaign/full/<name>_full.png (gitignored) and `tiles` cuts them into map/art/<name>; only tc_* full PNGs are ignored under map/art. (5) Targets for whole-map items are written `<map>:*`; the hunting_camp marker lives in map/data/world_markers.json, not maps.json, and is targeted as world:hunting_camp.
blocker: none
open: (a) 7 items carry a TODO in their notes: review:holy_mountain (no blender/landmarks/holy_mountain/build.py; its source is blender/world/yuanyu_holy_mount.py, so landmark.py stages may not apply); var:tc_mid:dawn, var:tc_mid:dusk, var:tc_low:dawn, var:tc_low:dusk (tiancheng_mid.py / tiancheng_low.py only have --day, night is the default; dawn / dusk lighting must be added first); var:tc_upper:16k (how the 16k DZI is registered in maps.json: replace base or alt); estate:b1b2 (eden_manor.py --view has B1 but no B2). (b) Specs the prompt did not give, assumed: isle:* 2400/64, base:tc_upper 8000/128, var:tc_upper:<period> 8000/128, estate:b1b2 2000/32; each says so in its notes. (c) base:world has no world final in logs/render_times.csv (only world_yuanyu drafts), so it uses the 8000/128 default.
item counts: standard 48 = estate 2, review 12, landmark 8, scene 7, basemap 11, variant 8; hero 19 = island 8, basemap 2, variant 5, estate 1, landmark 3; total 67.

pushed: not pushed (rejected, see blocker); the work is committed on branch s0c-naming
tests: node 629/630 (1 skipped; baseline identical) | smoke PASS | arch PASS | probes: none run (docs only)
deviations: (1) The plan counts 11 kinds of window.TC*; the code has 29 (18 set directly, 11 through P.register()), and 34 read-only compat getters in app/bridge.mjs; the tables use the real numbers. (2) Wave column has a third value, S6, for the chat keys 仓库 / 槽位, because decision D4 migrates them with the stash unification, not at S10. (3) baibai.mjs: the plan draft says appearance-bridge, the table proposes imagegen-bridge (the module's write path is drawing); flagged as open 8. (4) Table B rows for the core side of a pair say (keep) and the forwarder tavern/routine.mjs says (delete), so each pair is complete. (5) The tables were generated from one scratch script so the en and zh editions cannot drift; the script is not committed (no code in scope).

  To https://github.com/kcgoofee-jpg/my-tavern-experiments.git
   ! [rejected]        HEAD -> preview (non-fast-forward)
  error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/kcgoofee-jpg/my-tavern-experiments.git'
  hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote counterpart.
  Cause: origin/preview moved to head #102 (162a63f; render-line commits 6e84ad4, 089e569) after this branch was cut from head #101 (04d0811). tools/push_preview.sh pushes HEAD as it is and does not fetch or rebase, although brief §3 says it does.
  Options: A) rebase s0c-naming onto origin/preview (this branch touches only docs/naming*.md, tools/check_zh_mirror.py and the append-only log, so no conflict is expected), re-run the gates, push; B) leave it to you to push. Not force-pushed.
open: (a) DECISION: how the first pack keeps its legacy names (manifest-declared legacy prefixes vs rename everything and read old forever), especially the worldbook extra.eden_* markers. (b) DECISION: identifier prefix (spatial / Spatial assumed from D5), engine repo name, npm package name. (c) DECISION: util.mjs / shell.mjs need a split design; keep `$` by exception? (d) DECISION: `floor` (chat floor vs storey), imagegen-bridge vs appearance-bridge. (e) FOUND, NOT FIXED: app/host.mjs:52,54 call P.TCFog?.mute?.(), but fog.mjs never registers TCFog in P, so replay-time muting is a no-op. (f) FOUND: four read-only window hooks with no writer (__edenHostVersions, __edenHereText, __edenMvuSnapshotStatus, __composeTest); stale .js owner strings in core/storage.mjs KEYS (5 names, 8 keys).

deviations: (1) T1: 9 of the 12 untracked files in eden-campaign have the same path on origin/preview with different content (shipped Part 4-3 / 5-x versions); by the prompt's rule they were treated as stranded and rescued, on a branch that is never merged. (2) T2: .codebuddy/worktrees/webgl-part3 has uncommitted changes (blender/export_optimized.py, logs/render_times.csv, map/art/relief/*, tests/test_export_optimized.py, ...); not removed. (3) tests/app_modules.test.mjs: the fixed list of P keys gains 'TCFog' (a consequence of T4).
blocker: none
open: (a) webgl-part3 has uncommitted work: commit / discard / keep? (b) decide merge or drop for rescue/ambience-part4-4 (todo §1); its 9 overlapping files diverge from preview and would need a manual reconcile.

notes for the next session:
  (1) A fresh render worktree lacks the git-ignored local caches (blender/data/props, landmarks, estate2, osm/raw, real3d/raw, world/out, *.f32, *.i16), so landmark builds crash on missing textures and board.py then re-annotates STALE renders. Symlink them from the main checkout (ln -s <main>/blender/data/<dir> ...) and add them to the shared .git/info/exclude; done for wt-standard.
  (2) blender/estate: Blender 5.2 rejects modifier ID-property writes; core.set_cut now uses modifier.properties.inputs. Estate renders need --allow-unmatched 1 (5 maps.json function rooms have no 3D room) and --no-export (keeps eden_estate_tiles.json untouched).
  (3) `render_campaign.py wait` leaves the item at the same stage, so `next` re-offers it; do not resubmit a queued job.
